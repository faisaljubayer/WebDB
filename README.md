WebDB is a general purpose database created in C. This database was created to store and process data. To process, store, sort and manipulate data all the general and modern data structures and algorithms are implemented. Please feel free to contribute. This project is not production ready and should only be used for educational purposes only.  

**This project was mainly created by H.A.B.M. Faisal Akandha for a project in Daffodil University.**

# Architecture 
This database is heavily inspired by sqlite and thus it follows the same architecture that sqlite does.

**But more and more algorithms are added to the database to make storing and manipulating data a programmer's breeze.**

### Warning ! This project is currently under development !

## But how the heck this database work ?

A query goes through a chain of components in order to retrieve or modify data. The front-end consists of the:

* tokenizer
* parser
* code generator

The input to the front-end is a SQL query. the output is sqlite virtual machine bytecode (essentially a compiled program that can operate on the database).

The back-end consists of the:

* virtual machine
* B-tree
* pager
* os interface

The virtual machine takes bytecode generated by the front-end as instructions. It can then perform operations on one or more tables or indexes, each of which is stored in a data structure called a B-tree. The VM is essentially a big switch statement on the type of bytecode instruction.

Each B-tree consists of many nodes. Each node is one page in length. The B-tree can retrieve a page from disk or save it back to disk by issuing commands to the pager.

The pager receives commands to read or write pages of data. It is responsible for reading/writing at appropriate offsets in the database file. It also keeps a cache of recently-accessed pages in memory, and determines when those pages need to be written back to disk.

The os interface is the layer that differs depending on which operating system sqlite was compiled for.
