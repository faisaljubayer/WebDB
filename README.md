WebDB is a general purpose database created in C. This database was created to store and process data. To process, store, sort and manipulate data all the general and modern data structures and algorithms are implemented. Please feel free to contribute. This project is not production ready and should only be used for educational purposes only.  

**This project was mainly created by H.A.B.M. Faisal Akandha for a project in Daffodil University.**

# Architecture 
This database is heavily inspired by sqlite and thus it follows the same architecture that sqlite does.

**But more and more algorithms are added to the database to make storing and manipulating data a programmer's breeze.**
